Employees are entitled to 20 paid leaves per year, which includes both casual and sick leaves. They also have the privilege of carrying over up to five unused vacation days into a new calendar year but cannot extend this beyond that limit. However, additional leave for special occasions such as marriage or childbirth is provided at an authorized level upon approval from supervisors/managers and may vary based on seniority levels within the organization.
